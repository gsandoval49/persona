			<h1>Persona Case #1</h1>

			<!-- Persona section -->
			<h2>Persona | John Smith | 25 years old</h2>
			<p>Profession: Professional Artist. Paintings mainly acrylic and water based</p>
			<p>Technology: Macbook Pro, iPhone 6, and iPad uses to draw her skeletons of paintings. </p>
			<p>Attitudes and behavior: </p>
			<p>Frustrations and needs: He is human. He has a point where he knows if he’s losing it, He has to unplug from the world and pray and read the word, and talk with God. He is in ministry, so he gets paid a minimum salary. He has a goal to write a book to hopefully supplement money for the church and his future as a youth minister and future pastor in the church. He uses his head pastor as a mentor to help him through certain situations and his pastor uses a concordance/lexicon for his bible studies. With all these responsibilities and his natural spirit to want to help others, it’s easy to feel he’s pulled in different directions. He needs his quiet time with God in the early mornings, in the evenings, and the occasional emergency times during the day.</p>
			<p>Goals: His main goal is that when he speaks the youth understands where he’s coming from when explaining subjects, concepts, and definitions about the bible. His goal is to keep the message as simple as possible. He wants the youth ministry to apply it to their lives in a practical manner through painting a picture. He would like to keep his life as simple as he could so that when a student/friend/or Christ follower asks what he does or how he does it…He has specifics to give them. But they can tailor to what he does.</p>

			<!-- Use case section -->
			<h2>Use Case</h2>
			<p>His lead pastor gave him a task to speak on finances for the weekly message coming up. The lead pastor feels that it’s a subject that should be addressed to the youth ministry. He wants him to create a message tailored around the original Greek/Hebrew definitions of 2 specific verses. Over 50% of Jesus ministry were financial principles. The pastor gave him 2 verses to dive into and create a message surrounding those 2 verses. He’s welcome to refer to other verses with that SAME word used in the Greek/Hebrew, to help support the 2 main verses. He will use the lexicon/dictionary to define specific words in the verse. He will use those definitions to paint a picture of how that specific word was used in that context, in that time period, in that culture, and how that word applies to our youth today.</p>
