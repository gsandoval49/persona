			<h1>Persona Case #1</h1>

			<!-- Persona section -->
			<h2>Persona | Joan Smith | 25 years old</h2>
			<p id="first-paragraph">Profession: Professional Artist. Paintings mainly acrylic and water based</p>
			<p id="first-paragraph">Technology: Macbook Pro, iPhone 6, and iPad uses to draw her skeletons of paintings. </p>
			<p id="first-paragraph">Attitudes and behavior: Enjoys her time in the mornings to draw her paintings. She feels it calms her. She enjoys using her phone or iPad to give her ideas for her painting in the mornings. </p>
			<p id="first-paragraph">Frustrations and needs: She dislikes having to wait for her pages to load. She'll stay on something for 5 seconds and if a page doesn't load she'll be done with it. She needs a platform where she can showcase her most recent work. She enjoys doing events and hanging her work at the local coffee shop down the street. But if she can, she'll avoid having to drive anywhere. So that's why a website to display her work would be ideal.  </p>
			<p id="first-paragraph">Goals: She wants to make more money, have more exposure for her paintings. </p>
